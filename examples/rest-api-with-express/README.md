# Using romcal as a REST API with Express.js

First, from the parent `romcal` module:

```shell
# if necessary, if you are in the ./examples/web-browser directory
cd ../..

npm install
npm build
```

Then, from this module (`rest-api-with-express`):
```shell
cd examples/rest-api-with-express

npm install
npm run start
```

And open the URL provided by the terminal.\

Note: some browsers like Firefox has a built-in JSON viewer.
Another great tool to test REST APIs is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
